    h2 About us

    markdown: Sometimes, software bugs create accidental art. The Glitch Gallery is a place for those bugs. It's an enthusiastic embrace of mistakes, and a celebration of emergent beauty. It was established in December 2018 by <a href="https://morr.cc">Sebastian Morr</a>, also known as <a href="https://twitter.com/blinry">blinry</a>.

    markdown: If you have some accidental artwork yourself, you can <a href="<%= new_exhibit_path %>">submit it to the Museum</a> and share it with others! Also, if you have seen some art on the Internet, you can [suggest it to us](/submit/), and we will take care of the rest. Also, you can support the Museum by <a href="/support/">becoming a member!</a>

    markdown: The source code for this site is <a href="https://github.com/blinry/glitch-gallery">on GitHub</a>, feel free to suggest features, report bugs, or send pull requests!
