I was attempting to create an efficient approximation for a line-of-sight
test between two boxes. The naive method would be to send straight rays out
from the boundary of the "seeing"/source box and check intersections with
all other boxes. I thought I could use fewer rays by branching them as they
got further apart This was the visualization which showed me I had not
coded what I was envisioning. You can see the darker blue box which was the
source in the center and the green box test object in the lower right
corner.
