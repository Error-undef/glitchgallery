"Imagine a grid of equilateral triangles, and imagine that every edge is a spring (which I was working on because I was making [a game](http://viruspatterns.com) that involved hexagonal patterns and which I wanted to have some nice juice - I ended up scrapping this bit of juice though). But then, with that springy connectivity, initialize all the points to be at the origin. You should get this insane big bang/[stereographically projected grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX-0Laeczgk) effect seen here."
