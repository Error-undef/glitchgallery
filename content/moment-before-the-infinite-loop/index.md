During [Char's shaders workshop](http://charstiles.com/learn-livecoding-shaders/), I accidentally left an infinite loop in my vertex shader. Since KodeLife is constantly recompiling and running your program, infinite loops can cause the entire IDE to crash. The resulting canvas visualizes whatever data happened to be in the GPU registers from KodeLife's final moment.
