This glitch happened to me in the class "recreating the past" by Zach Lieberman at the School for Poetic Computation in 2019. We were supposed to recreate one of John Maeda's posters of the Morisawa 10 series. I tried to implement it in poststcript but could not figure out where the word was landing on the paper as

- all the measurements were relative and
- in an unknown scale and
- postscript is stack based and
- the order of operators is really peculiar, so I tried to mark the boundary box in red.
