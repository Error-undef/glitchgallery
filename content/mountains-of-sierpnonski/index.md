The artist was trying to hack together a simple solution for a programming exercise: Making a Sierpinski triangle in Python with the Turtle Module. They missed one line of code, and it took some time to find the problem. The exact problem is a missing turn at the end of each cycle.

You can find the exercise (all in German), as well as other recursion exercises, [here](https://www.inf-schule.de/algorithmen/rekursivealgorithmen/selbstaehnlichkeit/uebungen).
