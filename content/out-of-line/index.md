These pieces were created by a [buggy version](https://github.com/lambdaTotoro/ArtBots/blob/75df4993b08d8d2f2031d869ae994137b5e68bc2/Week%201%20-%20Variations%20on%20Variations/variations.py) of [Variations on Variations](https://botsin.space/@variations_on_variations), a python bot for Mastodon that creates images inspired by Max Bill's *Variations* series.

So it was always meant to generate art, but it did so very incorrectly. Angles don't line up, colours are not unique, some polygons escape the boundaries entirely, it's all a bit messed up. However, I also liked a few of the results for their own sake.
