These are images of a 3D simulation of the Voyager I and II space probes.

The trajectory data of several planets, moons and spacecrafts were obtained from the NASA JPL server. Due to the swing-by maneuvers of the space probe, the direction of movement sometimes changes within minutes, but storing 29 years of trajectory data with one-minute resolution was infeasible. 

To save storage space, several temporal resolutions were combined. Most glitches are either errors from stitching the different resolutions together, or attempts to debug those errors.
