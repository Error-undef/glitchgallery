It was an accidental image decoding glitch that produced these interesting and very colorful patterns, produced by [gpu_jpeg2k](https://github.com/ePirat/gpu_jpeg2k), a JPEG 2000 codec library using CUDA for fast GPU-based de- and encoding.

Due to a bug in the file reading and parsing code, it ended up reading invalid data, causing colorful glitch art.
