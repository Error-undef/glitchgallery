When bored with my current screen saver at one time in 2014, I thought it would
be awesome to have my screen saver be a blur of my desktop at the time I locked
it.

I did not keep the code that produced this wonderful catastrophe. But if I
remember correctly, the faulty blurring operation produced a value that was way
larger than it should have been which was subsequently wrapped to cram it into
8 bits, producing these colorful waves.
