While trying to generate an artwork using a Google Colab based software
called [Disco Diffusion](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sHfRn5Y0YKYKi1k-ifUSBFRNJ8_1sa39),
I tried to get rid of some elements, which I thought were wind turbines.
Using a negative weight turned out to have a very large, unintended effect.

The full text prompt was: “A windy coast on a cloudy day, by Caspar
Friedrich and Albert Bierstadt, featured on ArtStation:5”, “turbines,
towers:-10”

I enabled the RN50x16 model - everything else used the 4.1
default settings.
