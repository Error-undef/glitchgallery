This image was created while working on extensions for the raytracing 
software *tracey* as part of a university course. When building a 
volumetric light effect (rays of sunlight reflecting on dust particles 
in the air), there were various parameters to tweak for making the dust 
look like intended. Beginning with large amounts of opaque white dust, 
it looked more like a snowstorm at first. Which has its own kind of 
aesthetic and makes the sunny church scene look more like ruins on a 
postapocalyptic winter's night.
