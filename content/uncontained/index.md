This series of images created when I was working on [packing problems](https://morr.cc/split-packing/). The task was to find an algorithm which could always place the provided circles inside of the triangular container without overlapping each other. As you can see, many strategies were unsuccessful! :)

The drawings were done using [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/).
