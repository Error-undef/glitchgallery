On Jan 30th 2014, an anonymous user of an online image board complained that
their camera sensor had broken in an interesting way. Attached were 4 pictures
taken with said camera, this being one of them.

The timestamp suggests that the picture was taken on Jan 1st 2007. But given
the state of the camera, this might as well be a faulty clock and default
setting.
